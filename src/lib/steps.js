	// '<p>The Beatles are the only artist to come in under 10 years. With just 7 years and 1 month between their first and last album.</p>',

	// '<p>At the other end of the spectrum, are legacy acts like Barbara Streisand, The Rolling Stones, and Elton John who have somewhat steadily released albums over time.</p>',
	// // 6
	// `<p>Some artists' years of activity are somewhat inflated due to an album release after significant hiatuses. ABBA, Pink Floyd, and the Eagles each released albums more than 20 years after their previous works</p>`,

	// '<p>Most newer artists (ie debuted after 2000), still in their nascent years, have been active for less years. Though their inclusion on the best selling list despite only being active for 10-20 years is noteworthy.</p>',
