	`<p>Let's plot the albums by release date, with artists sorted by the release of their debut albums, from Frank Sinatra's 1946 debut <span class="album-title-text">The Voice of Frank Sinatra</span> to Ed Sheeran's 2011 debut <span class="album-title-text">=</span></p>`,

	`<p>Sorting by the years active allows us to easily compare the artists' careers</p>`,
	// 4 highlight the beatles only
	'<p>The Beatles are the only artist to come in under 10 years. With just 7 years and 1 month between their first and last album. Astonishing given their success.</p>',
	// 5 highlight barbs, rs, and elton
	'<p>At the other end of the spectrum, are legacy acts like Barbara Streisand, The Rolling Stones, and Elton John who have somewhat steadily released albums over time.</p>',
	// 6 highlight abba, pf, and eags
	`<p>Some artists', however, released albums after significant hiatuses. ABBA, Pink Floyd, and the Eagles each released albums more than 20 years after their previous works</p>`,
	// 7 highlight artists with debut > 2000
	'<p>11 of the 40 best selling artists debuted after 2000. Perhaps still in the nascency of their careers, they unsurprisingly have been active for fewer years.</p>'
